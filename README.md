# FlyWire Visual Neuron Types
All neurons intrinsic to the right optic lobe of a Drosophila adult female have been typed by analyzing the [FlyWire Connectome](https://flywire.ai).
This is a data repository containing annotations of the typed cells.

# Accompanying Manuscript
Our working paper [Connectomic cell types of the Drosophila optic lobe by Matsliah, Yu, and the FlyWire Consortium](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17kSjeFTFZBZG-Sy76YjCsZXOUq55jd-E?usp=drive_link) is open for feedback from members of the FlyWire Consortium. Comments have been enabled, and please contact us if you would like edit access.
## See Also
All 200+ intrinsic types are accessible from a [dedicated catalog page on Codex](https://codex.flywire.ai/app/optic_lobe_catalog).

# Versioning
The annotations are tied to Root IDs in static FlyWire release versions.
## Note of caution
Since some cells might get split/merged in between releases due to proofreading, these IDs are not 100% consistent across versions.
