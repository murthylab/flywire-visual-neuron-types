# FlyWire Visual Neuron Types
All neurons intrinsic to the right optic lobe of a Drosophila adult female have been typed by analyzing the [FlyWire Connectome](https://flywire.ai).
This is a data repository accompanying the manuscript [Neuronal "parts list" and wiring diagram for a visual system](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.12.562119).
## See Also
All 200+ intrinsic types are accessible from a [dedicated catalog page on Codex](https://codex.flywire.ai/app/optic_lobe_catalog).

# Versioning
The annotations are tied to Root IDs in static FlyWire release versions.
## Note of caution
Since some cells might get split/merged in between releases due to proofreading, these IDs are not 100% consistent across versions.
